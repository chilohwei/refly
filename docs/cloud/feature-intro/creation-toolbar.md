## Create Code Component

- **Concept:** Code components allow you to embed code content into the canvas and provide the following three view modes for better display and editing of code:
    1.  **Preview Mode:** Visually displays the running effect of the code, making it convenient for users to quickly understand the code's output.
    2.  **Code Mode:** Provides an interface focused on code editing, making it convenient for users to write and modify code.
    3.  **Split View:** Simultaneously displays the code and the preview effect, allowing users to see the impact of code changes on the preview effect in real-time.

    Code components support AI interaction features:

    *   Users can ask AI questions about the code content, such as "What does this code do?".
    *   Other AI nodes can directly generate code components, such as generating a piece of JavaScript code based on user requirements.

    Through code components, you can seamlessly integrate programming capabilities into the creation process, thereby improving work efficiency.

- **Operation:**

    1.  **Create a new code component node:** In the toolbar, click the `<>` button to create a new code component node on the canvas.


    2.  **Select code type:** In the dropdown box of the code component node, select the code type you want to use, such as HTML, JavaScript, or CSS.

    3.  **Edit code:** In the code editing area, you can enter or paste your code.

    4.  **Preview code:** The code component provides preview, code, and split views for you to easily check the code effect.

        *   **Preview View:** Displays the running result of the code.

        *   **Code View:** Focuses on code editing.

        *   **Split View:** Simultaneously displays the code and the preview effect, making it convenient for you to see the impact of code changes on the preview effect in real-time.

    5.  **Adjust preview effect:** In the preview view, you can use the buttons in the lower right corner to zoom in, download, or copy the image.

        ![](/images/2025-04-26-22-27-08.png)

    6.  **Modify code and preview in real-time:** If the preview effect is not ideal, you can use the split view to modify the code while viewing the preview effect in real-time. For complex code modifications, it is recommended to use professional IDE tools.

        ![](/images/2025-04-26-22-27-25.png)

    7.  **Exit code component:** After finishing modifications, you can press the `Esc` key or click the close button in the upper right corner to return to the canvas interface.
