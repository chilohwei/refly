# Search

Global search is a powerful feature in Refly that helps you quickly find all canvases and resources.

When you use global search, the system will prioritize displaying matching canvases. Then, it will search resources, matching resource names and keywords in the content.

You can quickly open global search by clicking the search box or using the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+K**.

Using global search, you can easily find historical canvases you have created before, and also conveniently add resources to the current canvas.
