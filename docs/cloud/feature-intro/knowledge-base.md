# Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is a powerful tool for centrally managing and retrieving your information. You can integrate documents, code snippets, web content, and canvases you create in Refly from different sources into the knowledge base, making it convenient for AI to retrieve and utilize.

## Core Concepts

The basic units that make up a knowledge base include:

*   **File:**
    *   Refers to document-like resources that are ultimately imported or clipped, such as uploaded documents, code files, content saved through web clipping, etc.
    *   These files are the basis for content retrieval in the knowledge base.
*   **Canvas:**
    *   Refers to the canvas projects created by users in Refly.
    *   After adding a canvas to the knowledge base, the content within the canvas can also be retrieved.

## Creating a Knowledge Base

Create a new knowledge base to organize your resources.

**Basic Information:**

*   **Name:** A unique identifier for the knowledge base, used for identification and referencing. It is recommended to use a concise and clear name.
*   **Description:** (Optional) Provides supplementary descriptions or background information about the knowledge base content to help understand its purpose.
*   **Preset Prompt:** (Optional) Sets a specific prompt for this knowledge base. This prompt will automatically take effect every time this knowledge base is called by AI, guiding the direction or content scope of the AI's response.

## Managing Knowledge Base

After creating a knowledge base, you can manage the canvases and file resources within it.

### Managing Canvases

You can search, add, delete, or remove canvases in the knowledge base.

**Main Operations:**

*   **Search:** Quickly find added canvases by name within the current knowledge base.
*   **Add:**
    *   **Add Existing Canvas:** Add other canvases you have created to the current knowledge base.
    *   **Create New Canvas:** Directly create a new canvas within the current knowledge base.
*   **Delete:** **(Please proceed with caution!)** This operation will permanently delete the canvas itself and all its content, and cannot be recovered.
*   **Remove from Knowledge Base:** Only unlinks the canvas from the current knowledge base; the canvas itself will not be deleted and will still exist in your canvas list.
